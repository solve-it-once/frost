# Platform.sh Project Initialization Template
#
# This file defines settings and workflow modifications that allow a git
# repository to be deployed to Platform.sh and its white-label partners. A
# project template can be a fully functioning ready-made application or a
# quick-start point for custom development work.
#
# It contains elements that affect the behaviour upon the initialisation of
# a new project (for example minimal plan sizes) as well as elements that
# allow Platform.sh to present it in a user interface (such as the description
# of the project, tags, an icon etc.).

# The schema is versioned so that we can establish code paths differently in the future if we need to change this.
version: 1

# Templates are a small amount of information supporting a template URL.
# Each template is selectable at the project-creation step.
info:
    # Unique machine name, prefaced by a vendor or organization identifier.
    # The vendor should be the lowercase name of your company, organization, or project, and the project name
    # the lowercase name of the template. This may be the same as the vendor in a single-product case.
    id: solve-it-once/frost
    # The human-readable name of the template.  This is how the template will be named in the user interface.
    name: Frost
    # Human-readable descriptive text for the template. Supports limited HTML.
    # This field should be 1-3 sentences describing how the project is setup, assuming the reader already knows what
    # the application is.
    description: |
      Frost is an easy-to-use, low-code, atomic componenet-based distribution of Drupal.
    # A list of tags associated with the template.  These should be highly generic terms like "CMS", "Framework", and
    # the language in which the application is written.
    tags:
        - PHP
        - CMS
    # An image URI (either base64-encoded or a URL) representing the template.  Base64-encoded SVG strongly preferred.
    image: data:image/svg+xml;...
    # Additional notes displayed in the template's detail view.
    # Each note object is displayed as a small section heading with content below. Supports limited HTML.
    # The most important is a section that lists the "Apps and Services" (container images) that the project uses.
    # These are the name/version of the Platform.sh containers, not including the Nginx router.
    notes:
        - heading: "Apps & Services"
          content: "PHP 7.2<br/>Postgresql 9.6"


# This key describes the initialization call made to the master environment at
# project creation time. This is part of the full v2 UI operation mode, which
# places project schema/options selection early in the creation process, rather
# than later as it exits now. To allow this schema to be backwards-compatible,
# this key also gets mapped to the appropriate location in project.settings so
# that the current UI can have its own workflow overridden as well.
